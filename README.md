# String To Variable Name

Extremely simple implementation of simple JS which allows for convertion of strings into C-style variable names.

Example "This is some field" will be converted into "thisIsSomeField" or "ThisIsSomeField" (supportes camel and Pascal case).

Needed this for a project I'm currently working on so I built something very simple in 15 minutes.
